/**
 * A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.
 * Implementors define a single method with no arguments called
 * {@code call}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Callable} interface is similar to {@link
 * java.lang.Runnable}, in that both are designed for classes whose
 * instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A
 * {@code Runnable}, however, does not return a result and cannot
 * throw a checked exception.
 * Callable接口和Runnable接口相似，都是设计给线程执行的
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class contains utility methods to
 * convert from other common forms to {@code Callable} classes.
 * Executors类包含了一个工具转换器：Runnable -> Callable
 *
 * Callable接口代表一段可以调用并返回结果的代码;Future接口表示异步任务，是还没有完成的任务给出的未来结果。所以说Callable用于产生结果，Future用于获取结果。
 *
 * Callable接口使用泛型去定义它的返回类型。Executors类提供了一些有用的方法在线程池中执行Callable内的任务。
 * 由于Callable任务是并行的（并行就是整体看上去是并行的，其实在某个时间点只有一个线程在执行），我们必须等待它返回的结果。
 *
 * java.util.concurrent.Future对象为我们解决了这个问题。
 * 在线程池提交Callable任务后返回了一个Future对象，使用它可以知道Callable任务的状态和得到Callable返回的执行结果。Future提供了get()方法让我们可以等待Callable结束并获取它的执行结果。
